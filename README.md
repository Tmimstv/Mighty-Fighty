# Mighty Fighty

Mighty Fighty is my first fighting game. I've completed the Unity Essentials Pathway as well as the Junior Developer Pathway. I'm mainly doing it to document my progress as I continue to grow as a game developer. Will be working on this for some time before moving on to my next project.


Going to eventually make a youtube playlist of the progress, but I am also working on other games right now so it may take time
